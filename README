Introducing nerdsz

For awhile now, I've been wanting something that could answer the question:
"What are my friends doing right now?"

There are probably already approximately 200 apps that do this, but for some
reason I couldn't find one that worked the way I wanted. So instead I took the
evening and hacked together nerdsz (pronounced "nerds-zee").

To use it, enter the twitter usernames of a group of people you're interested
in. For example, http://aaronboodman.com/nerdsz?aboodman,ev,biz,goldman. 

PS: You may be wondering about the name. For years now, I have been calling the
group of friends I hang out with the nerds. The z is an inside joke that you
probably have to work for Google to get. Sorry about that.

PPS: This hack made possible by twitter's awesome, crazy-easy-to-use API.
Thanks!

PPPS: I also borrowed John Resig's PrettyDate.

As of this commit, it looks like the Twitter API has changed, so this no longer
works.
